SOLID is a set of five principles in object-oriented programming that helps developers write better code. These principles make the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Here's a quick explanation of each principle:

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one job or responsibility. If a class does too many things, it becomes hard to manage and update.

2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new features by extending the class, but you shouldn’t change existing code.

3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a subclass should be able to replace objects of the parent class without affecting the program. This ensures that subclasses behave the same as the parent class.

4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Don’t force a class to implement methods it doesn't need. It's better to create smaller, specific interfaces rather than one large general interface.

5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). This makes the code more flexible and easier to change.
